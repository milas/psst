# psst ðŸ¤«
Sometimes you need to take a little peek at your Kubernetes secrets...

# Usage
You can run `psst` without any arguments to interactively pick the secret and key whose value you want to see.

```shell
$ psst
âœ”  Choose secret: â€¦ my-secret
âœ”  Choose key: â€¦ my-key
my-value
```

Alternatively, you can run `psst SECRET KEY` to get the value directly.

It's also possible to only provide the `SECRET` and interactively choose the key.

If the secret only contains a single key, it'll be chosen automatically.

Run `psst --help` for all options. (For example, you can use the standard `kubectl` flags to specify namespace and/or context.)

# Installation
If you've got Go installed:
```shell
go install 'github.com/milas/psst@latest'
```

You can also build & install in one command with Docker (you do not need to clone the repo):
```shell
DEST="${HOME}/.local/bin/" docker buildx bake \
  'https://github.com/milas/psst.git'
```
> Be sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH` or pick a different directory.
